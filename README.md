# FRUIT INSPECTION
This is a project work for Computer Vision and Image Processing course at the University of Bologna.

By running the jupyter notebook [report.ipynb](report.ipynb) you can see the code and the results obtained, togheter with some further explanations concerning the choices made.

The aim of the project was to solve 3 main tasks.

## First task
Images in folder [first task](imgs/first_task) show three apples with clear external defects. I have to outline the fruit by generating a binary mask and then search for the defects in each fruit.

## Second task
Images in folder [second task](imgs/second_task) show two apples with an unwanted reddish-brown area. I should identify the russet or at least some part of it with no false positive areas (if possible), in order to correctly classify the two fruits.

# Third task
Images in folder [final challenge](imgs/final_challenge) show 5 kiwis. I should segment the fruits and locate the defect in image “000007”. Special care should be taken to remove as “background” the dirt on the conveyor as well as the sticker in image “000006”.
